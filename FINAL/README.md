So what I wanted to accomplish was the creation of a Mariah-verse, influenced by the power of Mariah Carey fans everywhere accessing the “All I Want for Christmas is you” music video. I started off with grabbing data from the YouTube API, and then simply grabbing the current view count and comparing it a starting view count. A certain amount of new views would render a new planet, which was done using WebGL and 3.js. I textured each of the new planets in this Mariah-verse with an image of Mariah Carey, giving users the full Mariah Carey experience.

This project wasn't amazingly hard or anything, it was just a matter of piecing some data together. Getting the YouTube API to work properly was a bit of a hassle, since it seems like not a lot of people just want the viewcount for a particular video.
